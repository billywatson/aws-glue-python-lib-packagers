#+Title: Package python libs for AWS Glue jobs.


* Overview
Including additional python libraries for AWS Glue jobs requires them to be packaged in a certain way and uploaded to S3. Use the dockerfiles in this repository to isolate the installation and packaging of these libraries. These files use the =pg8000= library as an example, but can be modified to use any *pure*[fn:1] python library.

- =Dockerfile= :: Packages libraries into a =.zip= file so that they can be used with AWS Glue PySpark jobs.
- =Dockerfile-egg= :: Packages libraries into a =.egg= file for use with AWS Glue Python shell jobs.


* How to use

Run the following commands.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Build the docker image.
docker build -t build_pyyaml --build-arg PYTHON_PACKAGE=pyyaml .
# OR let's say you need a specifc version of the package, you can specify it, requirements-style:
docker build -t build_pyyaml --build-arg PYTHON_PACKAGE=pyyaml==5.1.2 .

# Generate the zip file needed (either way you run it above, the run command is the same)
docker run --rm --name build_pyyaml -v $PWD/zips:/zips build_pyyaml

# Copy the file to S3.
aws s3 cp ./zips/pg8000.zip s3://my-glue-libs/
#+END_SRC


[fn:1] AWS Glue only supports pure python libraries. So for example, =pg8000= works, but =psycopg2= does not.
